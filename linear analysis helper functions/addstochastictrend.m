% ADDSTOCHASTICTREND adds a stochastic trend to a given time series (for
% simulating purposes). The time series of stochastic trend is generated by
% simulating a random walk time series of the same length as that of the
% given time series.
% INPUT

% OUTPUT
% - yV      : vector of length 'n' of the sum of the given time series and
%             a stochastic trend.
